# Bash

## Defining variables

- Need to leave out spaces
- Dollar sign retrieves the value of the variable
- Without dollar sign, the symbol itself is being used, just as in quotes.
```sh
x=4
echo $x
echo x
echo 'x'
echo "x"
```

## Control flow in the shell

Put at beginning of script:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
```
Hash/bang defines that this is a bash script and calls bash to run it. May not be necessary in bash anymore.
-> then make script executable using `chmod u+x`

Counting characters in all pdf files separately using a for loop:
```sh
for i in *.pdf
do
	echo $i
	wc -c < $i
done
```
if statement:
```sh
if [[ condition ]]; then
	#statements
fi
```

case statement:
```sh
case word in
	pattern )
		;;
esac
```

How to deal with input from the command line:
```sh
set -u
echo $1
```
$1 is the first argument from the command line.
If not given, it will expand to nothing and not give an error, unless `set -u` is set.

Using a subshell:
```sh
for i in $(seq 10)
do
	echo $i
done
```
-> the brackets mean that seq 10 will be run in a subshell.
-> without the brackets, seq and 10 would be interpreted as words and would not be executed, but echoed themselves.

Testing if the previous command ran cleanly:
```sh
if test $? -ne 0
then
	echo "There was an error!"
fi
```

## Useful bash commands

You can use all of these (and more) little programs inside the shell, even if the shell doesn't know them yet, if it can find them in the path, it will run them. No need to import libraries, unlike in python.
```sh
man program # To look at the manual of a small bash program in less
less file # read a file in less
cat file # input a filename, output the contents of the file. Can then pipe the contents to the next program.
seq 10 # like range in python
touch xxx # makes or updates a file called xxx
mv -i file1 file2 # Renaming files. To take car not to overwrite files, use -i
read x # Reads a line of input and puts it into a variable called x
basename # Gives you the last name in a path
dirname # Gives you the directory part of a path
type program # Tells you where in your path sth will be found
type -all echo # Shows you the path of all programs called echo.
echo $PATH # To see your shell PATH
tr a b # Translate between characters
test EXPRESSION # Figures out whether the expression is true or false
test -f filename # Check if a file already exists. Useful in loops, eg when renaming files
[ # is the same command as test!! 
```

## exit status

for grep:
exit status 0 = successful
exit status 1 = unsuccessful
exit status 2 = error

-> this can be different for different programs, have a look in the man page of the specific program to know.

`$?` holds the exit status of the last command.

## Output and error

Output can be directed to stdout and stderr:
```sh
ls skldjfskdghdaf > out 2>errors
```
