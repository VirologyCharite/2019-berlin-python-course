## Homework for day 3

* Add `--start` and `--stop` args to `find-motifs-re.py`.
* Keep track of results from the matching and print a summary
  (hint: see `find-motifs-re-summary.py`).
* Add a command line option for `--max-pattern-length` and ignore any
  patterns that are longer than that.
* Add a command line option for `--min-pattern-length` and ignore any
  patterns that are longer than that.
* Write a fun utility program to read a temperature in degrees Celcius and
  convert it to Fahrenheit (and print the result). Call it `c2f.py`. Put it
  in your `~/bin` directory.
* Write a new matcher program, with a `--target` argument that moves a
  window along the input sequences looking for the target, with a
  user-specified maximum number of mismatched nucleotides. Make it print
  out the locations of matches.
* Think of some other interesting or fun or whatever script to write and
  put it in your bin.
