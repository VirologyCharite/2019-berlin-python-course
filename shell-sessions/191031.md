* Who is the note taker for this session? --> Tali
* Where are the notes from last time? Are there any? --> Tali, will add them
* Notes are at [https://github.com/VirologyCharite/2019-berlin-python-course](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/2019-berlin-python-course)
  in the `shell-sessions` directory. Files are named `190924.md`, `191031.md`, etc.
* Do I go too fast?
* The Bash Cookbook ([PDF](http://jon.es/other/bashcookbook.pdf))
  looks pretty good. Please buy a copy if you find it useful.

* Christian [FASTA relabelling](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/20191008-christian-relabelling)
  relabelling problem - not shell, but a simple Python hack.
* Read the `man` page.
* Quoting: hard vs soft quotes.
* `case` statement.
* Arithmetic with `$((...))`.

## Starting discussion

* Learn how to use bash and your editor efficiently (use SublimeText plugins, etc)
* Decision: read the bashcookbook together
* Read chapter 2 of the bashcookbook (link above) for next time (goal:
  understand as much as possible and ask questions next time)

## spread3 hack

* In the web browser, you can look at the console and see the script/error messages.
* Browsers are not supposed to be able to read from the file system.
* --> goal: paste data into `main.js`, so that the browser doesnt't have to try to read it in
* 'render' means draw something on the screen.
* Commands in parentheses (see below) are run in a sub-shell and all output can be directed to `bigfile.txt`
```sh
(
 echo 'lalalala'
 cat file.txt
) > bigfile.txt
```

## Tail

```sh
$ tail 156 # gives the last 156 lines of a file
$ tail +156 # gives all lines, starting from line 156 to the end
```

## Regexp and sed

* Regular expression in `sed`
```sh
sed 's/main.js/XXX/' # Here, the dot is interpreted as a regular expression special character (matches any character)
sed 's/main\.js/XXX/' # Here the dot matches only a dot
# s means substitute, / are the delimeters of what to substitute into what
sed 'y/abc/def/'

# y translates one character into another, just like `tr abc def`
tr -d xyz # deletes all x, y and z from a string
tr -d [:alnum:] # deletes all alphanumeric values
tr -s # can 'squeeze' runs of repeated characters down to just one character.
ls -l
```

* Metacharacters
```sh
echo [zx]* #  out: [zk]* if there are no files containing these letters, the names of the files if there are filenames containing these letters
d=4
echo $d # $ is a metacharacter
4
```
* Quotes
```sh
'' # Single quotes are "hard" quotes, anything inside will not be interpreted
"" # Double quotes are "soft" quotes
$ d=4
$ echo "hello $d"
hello 4
$ echo 'hello $d'
hello $d
# or to avoid metacharacters being expanded, put a backslash in front of each of them
$ echo "hello \$d"
hello $d
```

## Man pages
* Read the man pages!

```sh
man bash
man tr
```

## Less

* do a `/` and type something, `less` searches for it.
* then do an `n` to jump to the next result.
* if you do an `N`, it jumps to the previous result.
