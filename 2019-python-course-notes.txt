- We will be learning both Python and the shell

Strg = Ctrl

Step 1: Get a github.com account and send your username to Terry.

BASH is a type of shell. "Command line" and "terminal" are basically synonyms for the shell.
 
Unix commands
N.B. Ubuntu is a flavor of Linux, which is a type of Unix.

typing "date" shows the date.
pressing Ctrl+L clears the BASH screen.
typing "ls" shows the list of files in the current directory.
typing "echo x" prints whatever x is. e.g. typing "echo hello", prints "hello".
typing "pwd" prints the working directory. This is your current location in the tree.

N.B. pay attention to slash directions. Windows uses \ whereas UNIX uses / to specify the directory.
 
typing "cd" takes you home.
typing "cd /home" specifies the destination as home. This is called an argument.
typing "cd /" takes you to the top of the tree.
typing "ls -l" is a long listing, which shows you even more detailed information than "ls" alone.
typing "ls -l | less" runs the ls -l program in a way so that all the output is visible on one screen without the need for mouse scrolling.
typing "|" is called a pipe. Pipes are metacharacters and indicate that the user is trying to connect two different programs.
N.B. spaces around a pipe are optional.

typing " " (space button) while the less program is running, pages forward and backward.
The pipe takes the output of the first program and feeds it as the input into the second program.
typing "q" is the command for qutting a running program and returning to the shell.

pressing the up-arrow while on the command line recalls previous commands.
pressing Ctrl+R allows you to search previous commands.


pressing Ctrl+A takes you to the beginning of the line.
pressing Ctrl+E takes you to the end of the line.
pressing Ctrl+B takes you back a character.
pressing Ctrl+F takes you forward a character
pressing Ctrl+D deletes a character.
pressing Alt+B takes you back a word.
pressing Alt+F takes you forward a word.
pressing Alt+D deletes a word.
pressing Enter runs the command line.

the word counting program is "wc" which outputs 3 numbers (lines, words, and characters including spaces).
N.B. the wc program adds an extra character for creating a new line. So "abc" returns 4 characters.
typing "wc -c" counts characters.
typing "wc -l" counts lines.
typing "wc -w" counts words.

"grep" is a program that searches for patterns in files.
e.g. "grep TextYouAreSearchingFor filename | less" shows you all the lines containing the desired text.
e.g. "grep '>' xxx.fasta" will search the fasta file and only return lines containing '>'

"cut" is a program that deletes certain characters.
e.g. "Text Input | cut -f1 -d' ' | less" will cut the text after the first space, yielding "Text".

"sort" is a program that sorts inputs.
N.B. "sort" sorts inputs alphabetically, "sort -n" will sort files numercially.
 
uniq is a program that provides only unique outputs.
e.g. where less might provide 1,1,2,3 as outputs, uniq only provides 1,2,3 as an output, omitting the second 1.
"uniq -c" will count the number of instances of each unique output.

cp is a program which copies a file.

"tail -n 1" shows only the final line of a file.
"head" shows a file from the beginning.

To access the manual, simply type man, followed by a command that you would like to learn more about.

cat filename.py
The above function returns the whole text of the filename in shell. cat is short for catenate.

* is a wildcard, which allows you to pull down multiple matches with a part of their name in common.
e.g. *.py returns all python files.

typing "ls -lt" sorts files in the current directory by timestamp.

mkdir makes a directory.

To access your Windows directory from Ubuntu filesystem, use the following command:
cd /mnt/c/Users/emanuelj/Desktop

Python notes
Variables can be strings ('text'), integers (1,2,3), Boolean variables (True or False), or floating numbers (2.13456373).
Flow control methods include if/then statements, for example:

x = 9
if x > 8:
	print("x is greater than 8.")
else:
	print("x is smaller than 8.")

When the program above runs, "x is greater than 8." will be printed on the screen.

To open a file in python, use the following command:
x = open('filename.fasta')

Then, you can iterate over the variable x, reading the file line by line (the following program would print every line of the file you opened):
for line in x:
	print(line)

To read a file in python, use the following command:
x = open('filename.fasta').read()
This should save the entire file as a single variable.

Lists are one type of data structure in python.
shoppingList = ['milk','bread','butter']

typing shoppingList[1] = 'bread'

Sets are another type of data structure in python.
names = set()
names.add('Kyra')
names.add('Julia')
This returns a set {'Kyra','Julia'}

Dictionaries are another data structure in python.
ages = {}
ages['Fabian'] = 28
ages['Jackson'] = 26
This returns a dictionary {'Fabian': 28, 'Jackson': 26}
del ages[Jackson] would delete the Jackson value from the dictionary, returning only {'Fabian': 28}
Dictionaries can also contain additional dictionaries, allowing you to nest dictionaries within each other.

The .strip() function in python, cleans up empty spaces at the beginning and end of variables.

The import function in python allows you to load additional packages of functions into python.

For good programming practice, it's best to make your python programs as general as possible so they can accept multiple input types.
This makes it easier to adjust the types of input in the shell, rather than changing the code each time in python.

Standard Input (stdin), Standard Output, and Stardard Error will print to the terminal by default.

In python,
"x = x + 1" is such a common expression that there is also a shortcut:
"x += 1"
