* Who is the note taker for this session? --> Tali
* Where are the notes from last time? Are there any? --> Tali, will add them
* Notes are at [https://github.com/VirologyCharite/2019-berlin-python-course](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/2019-berlin-python-course)
  in the `shell-sessions` directory. Files are named `190924.md`, `191031.md`, etc.
* Do I go too fast?
* The Bash Cookbook ([PDF](http://jon.es/other/bashcookbook.pdf)) looks pretty good. Please buy a copy if you find it useful.
* Christian [spread3 hack](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/convert-spread3)
* Christian [FASTA relabelling](https://github.com/VirologyCharite/20191008-christian-relabelling) - not shell, but a simple Python hack.
* Read the `man` page.
* Quoting: hard vs soft quotes.
* `case` statement.
* Arithmetic with `$((...))`.

## Starting discussion
* Learn how to use bash and the editor efficiently (use Plugins, etc)
* Decision: read the bashcookbook together
* Read chapter 2 of the bashcookbook until next time (goal: understand as much as possible and ask questions next time)

## spread3 hack
* in the web browser, you can look at the console and see the script/error messages
* browsers are not supposed to be able to read from the file system
* --> goal: paste data into `main.js`, so that the browser doesnt't have to try to read it in
* 'render' = 'put sth on the screen'
* with brackets, all output will be directed to bigfile.txt
```sh
(
 echo 'lalalala'
 cat file.txt
) > bigfile.txt
```
```sh
tail 156 # gives the last 156 lines of a file
tail +156 # gives all lines from line 156 to the end
```
* Regular expression in `sed` and some `tr`
```sh
sed 's/main.js/XXX/' # Here, the dot is interpreted as a regular expression, so any character matches the dot
sed 's/main\.js/XXX/' # Here the dot matches only a dot
# s means substitute, / are the delimeters of what to substitute into what
sed 'y/abc/def/'

# y translates one character into another, just like `tr abc def`
tr -d xyz # deletes all x, y and z from a string
tr -d [:alnum:] # deletes all alphanumeric values
tr -s # can 'squeeze' away repeated characters
ls -l
```
* Metacharacters
```sh
echo [zx]* #  out: [zk]* if there are no files containing these letters, the names of the files if there are filenames containing these letters
d=4
echo $d # $ is a metacharacter
```
* Quotes
```sh
'' # Single quotes are hard quotes, anything inside will not be interpreted
"" # Double quotes are soft quotes
d=4
echo "hello $d" # out: hello 4
echo 'hello $d' # out: hello $d
# or to avoid metacharacters being expanded, put a backslash in front of each of them
echo "hello \$d"
```

## Man pages
* Read the man pages!
```sh
man bash
man tr
```

## Less
* do a `/` and type sth, then it searches for it
* then do an `n` shows the next result
if you do an `N`, results are shown backwards
