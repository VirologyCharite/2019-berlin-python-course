## Tools

```sh
paste # puts things together
cut # takes things apart
uniq # throws away identical copies of lines
sort # sorts stuff
```

Examples for these tools
```sh
cut -c1-4  # will print out the first 4 characters
cut -f1 -d. # will give the first field with the delimeter being a dot
cut -f1,3 -d. # will give first and thrid field with the delimeter being a dot

uniq -c # counts how many

sort -nr # sorts numerically in reverse

tr A-Z a-z # translates upper case letters into lower case letters
```

- `()` executes a command, so:
```sh
d=date
$d # will print 'date'

d=(date)
$d # will print the actual date
```

- `$@`
