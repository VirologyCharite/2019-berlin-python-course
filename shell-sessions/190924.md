# Bash

## Defining variables

- Need to leave out spaces around the `=` sign.
- Use a dollar sign to retrieve the value of the variable.
- Without dollar sign, the shell just interprets the variable name as a string.

```sh
$ x=4
$ echo $x
4
$ echo x
x
$ echo 'x'
x
$ echo "x"
x
```

## Control flow in the shell

Put at beginning of script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
```

The "Hash/bang" line defines that this is a bash script, which causes the
operating system to call bash to run it. Actually, it looks like this line
is not necessary in bash anymore.

Make scripts directly executable using `chmod u+x FILENAME.sh`.


Counting characters in all PDF files separately using a `for` loop:

```sh
for i in *.pdf
do
	echo $i
	wc -c < $i
done
```

`if` statement:

```sh
if [ condition ]
then
	#statements
fi
```

case statement:
```sh
case word in
    pattern1)
        # Commands...
    ;;
    pattern2)
        # Commands...
    ;;
esac
```

How to deal with input from the command line:

```sh
set -u
echo $1
```

`$1` is the first argument from the command line.

If not given, the above will expand to nothing and not give an error,
unless `set -u` (exit if undefined variables are used) is set.

Using a subshell:

```sh
for i in $(seq 10)
do
	echo $i
done
```

-> the parentheses mean that `seq 10` will be run in a subshell.

-> without the brackets, seq and 10 would be interpreted as words and would not be executed, but printed themselves.

Testing if the previous command ran cleanly:

```sh
if test $? -ne 0
then
	echo "There was an error!"
fi
```

`$?` is a special variable that always holds the exit status (`0` = no
error, non-zero = some kind of error occurred) of the last command.

## Useful bash commands

You can use all of these (and many more) little programs on the command
line, even if the shell doesn't know them yet, if it can find them in the
PATH environment variable (see `echo $PATH`), it will run them. No need to
import libraries, unlike in python.

```sh
man program # See the manual entry for a command (output is shown in less).
less file # Read a file in less.
cat file # Give it a filename, prints the contents of the file to the terminal. Can then pipe the contents to the next program.
seq 10 # like range in python.
touch xxx # makes or updates (the date on) a file called xxx.
mv -i file1 file2 # Rename files. To take care not to overwrite files, use -i to make it interactive.
read x # Reads a line of input and puts it into a variable called x.
basename # Gives you the last name in a file path.
dirname # Gives you the directory part of a path.
type program # Tells you where in your PATH a command will be found.
type -all echo # Shows you the path location of all programs called echo.
echo $PATH # Look at your shell's PATH variable.
tr a b # Translate characters.
test EXPRESSION # Test the value of an expression for true or false
test -f filename # Check if a file already exists. Useful in loops, e.g. when renaming files
[ # is the same command as test!! 
```

## exit status

grep:

* exit status 0 = successful
* exit status 1 = unsuccessful
* exit status 2 = error

See `man grep`.

Exit status will be different for different programs, have a look in the man page
of the specific program to know.

`$?` holds the exit status of the last command, as mentioned above.

## Output and error

Standard output and standard error can be redirected into separate files.

```sh
$ ls skldjfskdghdaf >out 2>errors
```
